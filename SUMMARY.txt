React is a UI Library

It helps us create UI components that we can re-use easily across our application.

It combines (or can) JS, HTML(-like) constructs and CSS in each component like a self-contained component.

	CSS can be done with a variety of NPM packages like styled-components or CSS modules

	This part is still in a stage of evolution... things are changing.
